<p>This is where our team stores any useful tid-bits of code that they've used for testing, fun little projects, etc.</p>

<h3>
<a id="new-ideas" class="anchor" href="#new-ideas" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>New Ideas:</h3>

<p>Here is Prism our team is coming up with new ideas all the time. Some becoming huge useful projects and others are partially developed, converted into class headers, etc. Once an idea comes about it is never thrown away, it might not ever be completely developed but the source code (however much is written) will be kept for further review, new consideration, and lastly small sections of the code may become useful at some point in time.</p>

<a id="building-upon-others" class="anchor" href="#building-upon-others" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Building upon others:</h3>

<p>There are limitless numbers of open source projects (some old and abandoned, and some huge and continuing to grow), who knows a header file from a long ago abandoned project may save a lot of development time. Headers tend to take a long time to become actually useful. Every piece of open source code is considered when working on a new feature or project.</p>

<p>If you are having trouble with any of our projects please file a report using the project's issue system. The team cannot possibly try to look through the contact form responses and try to keep track of everything; Because of this NO ATTEMPT will be made to fix any reported problems sent on the contact form. If you would like new features, have a problem with code running, etc please use the issues page. Hopefully the projects made by our team become of somewhat use to you.</p>
