To include MyClasses through the Header file do the following-

1) Put this at the top of the file with the other preprocessers:
  #include "MyClass.h"
2) Put this where ever you need to access it within the code:
  MyClass mc();
  (switching MyClass with whatever class within the Header you'd like to use)
